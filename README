All parameters have defaults, shown below except for owned_resources,
whose default is an empty list. Note that a resource should be owned
by only one host in the cluster, though different hosts may own
different resources.

heartbeat { 'clustername':
  onwed_resources = [ '127.0.0.2', 'http' ],
  key = 'clustername', # ignored if auth_method is crc
  iface = 'eth0',
  auth_method = 'sha1', # or crc, md5
  ensure = present, # or absent
}
